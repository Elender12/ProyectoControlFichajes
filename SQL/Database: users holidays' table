-Start the Apache and MySQL modules on XAMPP
-Launch HeidiSQL and open the saved connection (the one created in the installation process, that I called "localhost")
*** ATTENTION: You will probably have to add your phpMyAdmin password in the sessions administrator/settings tab , and then click on "save",
 otherwise it won' t let you connect.
-Once you are in, you find the list of databases on the left, and "fingerprintassistancecontrol" should appear.

USERS HOLIDAYS' TABLE:
This table is to show for each worker all the days that they ask permission to be set as holidays,
apart from the annual holidays(christmas etc)

-Right click on the name of the database in the list on the left ("fingerprintassistancecontrol") and click on "create new..." "...table"
-Set the table name: "usersholidays", then add the following columns:
  
 1-name: auto-increment, data type: INT, length/without sign/allow null/fill with zeros: leave blank,
   predetermined value: AUTO-INCREMENT
   Set it as primary key by right clicking on the column name and clicking on "create new index..." "...primary"
   
 2-name: userDni, data type: VARCHAR, length: 50, without sign/allow null/fill with zeros/predetermined value: leave blank
   Once this column it's created, select "foreign keys" from the top tabs and add:
   key name: userDni, columns: select "userDni", Reference table: select "users", Foreign columns: select "dni"
   Click enter to save.
   
 3-name: date, data type: DATE, length/without sign/allow null/fill with zeros/predetermined value: leave blank
