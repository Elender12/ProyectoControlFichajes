-From the website "https://www.heidisql.com/download.php" download the "Installer, 32/64 bit combined".
-Open the .exe file, accept the license agreement.
-Choose the folder to install the program into(it must be inside "C:\Users\YourUserName",
 because installation is not permitted outside of that folder).
-Choose whether you want a folder in the start menu or not.
-Select the additional setups you may want (I only chose the updates check and the dark theme).
-Finish the installation process and start the program.
-Open Xampp, start the Apache and MySql module.
-In the sessions admin page("administrador de sesiones") that opens up when you start HeidiSQL click the bottom left button "new" to 
 create a new connection, and give it a name you like (I put "localhost"), press enter on your pc so it gets saved and then fill in 
 the fields on the right with this info:
 Network type: MariaDB or MySQL (TCP/IP)
 Library: libmariadb.dll
 host name/IP: 127.0.0.1
 Ask for credentials: do not select anything
 User: root
 Password: leave blank
 Port: 3306
Do not add/select anything else and click on open.
