To create a chart in a webpage I followed some parts of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DQP4fpmJpc

I went to https://developers.google.com/chart and clicked on "guides" from the top menu,
 the selected "line chart" from the left-side menu.

I copied the code from below the "Curving the lines" paragraph and adapted it.

To keep html and css code separate, create 2 separate files, one with html extension,
 and the other with css extension, and save them in their respective "HTML" ad "CSS" folders in your project's folder.

To link the css file with the html one, write this in the <head> tag of the html file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

The href part is where the program will look for your css file.
 If it was in the same folder as the html file you would only need to write "filename.css",
 while to "go up in the folders" you put "./" before the css filename, one "." if you go up one folder level, ".." if you go up 2,
 and if you go up one or more folders from the folder where the HTML file is saved, and you need to go into another folder,
 you have to specify the name of that folder after the points, for example:

 Into projectFolder you have subfolder1, subfolder2-HTML and subfolder3-CSS.

 To link the css file that is in the subfolder3-css folder from the html file that is in the subfolder2-html folder, you write:

 <link rel="stylesheet" href="../subfolder3-CSS/filename.css">
